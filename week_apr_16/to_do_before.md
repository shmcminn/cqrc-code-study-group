# Things to do before week 2 meeting

- Read the introductory documentation for [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/), both of which we will likely be using to extract and organize our gun data. 

- If you want to practice what we went over last time, make a `list` of five `dictionaries` that represents a data set describing attributes of our study group. For each dictionary, have at least one `boolean` value, one `string` value, one `integer` OR `float` value and one `list` value. All the keys should be strings. 

Here's an example:

```python
  [{
    "name": "Sean",
    "cqrc_experience_yrs": 2.5,
    "is_manager": False,
    "programming_language_experience": ["python", "js", "R", "php"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Ryan",
    "cqrc_experience_yrs": 10,
    "is_manager": False,
    "programming_language_experience": ["python"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Randy",
    "cqrc_experience_yrs": 4,
    "is_manager": True,
    "programming_language_experience": ["js", "php"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Maite",
    "cqrc_experience_yrs": 1,
    "is_manager": False,
    "programming_language_experience": ["python", "js"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Paul",
    "cqrc_experience_yrs": 0,
    "is_manager": False,
    "programming_language_experience": ["stata"]
  }]

```
