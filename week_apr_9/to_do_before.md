# To do before study group

* Install a text editor such as Sublime or Visual Studio Code
* Install Python 3
* Set up a virtual environment
* Activate your virtual environment by using the `cd` command to change into the directory, then use `source bin/activate`
* Make sure `pip install` is working inside your virtual environment by `pip` installing `jupyter`

Directions for all of this can be found at Ben Welsh's [First Python Notebook](http://www.firstpythonnotebook.org/index.html)
